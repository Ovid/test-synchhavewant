=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Most;
    use Test::SynchHaveWant qw/
        have
        want
    /;

    my $have = some_complex_data();

    eq_or_diff have($have),  want(), 'have and want should be the same';

    __DATA__
    [
        {
            'bar' => [ 3, 4 ],
            'foo' => 1
        },
        0,
        bless( [ 'this', 'that', 'glarble', 'fetch' ], 'Foobar' ),
    ]

If you wish to synch:

    use Test::Most;
    use Test::SynchHaveWant qw/
        have
        want
        synch
    /;

    my $have = some_complex_data();

    eq_or_diff have($have),  want(), 'have and want should be the same';
    is have(0), want(), '0 is 0';

    # note that we can use normal tests
    my $want = want();
    isa_ok $want, 'Foobar';
    is_deeply $have($some_object), $want, '... and the object is the same';
    synch();

    __DATA__
    [
        {
            'bar' => [ 3, 4 ],
            'foo' => 1
        },
        0,
        bless( [ 'this', 'that', 'glarble', 'fetch' ], 'Foobar' ),

=head1 DO NOT USE THIS CODE WITHOUT SOURCE CONTROL

This is C<ALPHA CODE>. It's very alpha code. It's dangerous code. It attempts to
B<REWRITE YOUR TESTS> and if it screws up, you had better be using B<SOURCE
CONTROL> so you can revert.

That being said, if you need this code and you really, really understand
what's going on, go ahead and use it at your own risk.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you have extremely volatile data/code and you I<know> your tests are
correct even though they've failed due to subtle differences in how data is
created.  The first pass I had at solving this problem was to effectively
compute the edit distance for data structures, but even that failed as
differences emerged over time (see
L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/02/is-almost.html>).

For this module, we're giving devs a chance to rewrite their test results on
the fly, assuming that the new results of their code is correct.

This is generally an I<INCREDIBLY STUPID IDEA>.  It's very stupid.  Not only
do we attempt to rewrite your __DATA__ sections, we make it very easy for
you to have bogus tests because you may incorrectly assume that the new data
you're returning is correct.  That's why this is a B<BIG, FAT, DANGEROUS
EXPERIMENT>.

Sadly, I've been asked a couple of times why I feel the need to experiment
with writing tests in this area, but I can't tell you that due to my NDA.

=head1 USAGE

To make this work, you must have a C<__DATA__> section in your code. This
section should contain L<Data::Dumper> output of an array reference with each
value being a subsequent expected test result.

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 C<have>

 is have($have), want(), 'have should equal want';

Ordinarily this function is a no-op. It merely returns the value it is passed.
However, if synch is called at the end of the test run, the values passed to
this function will be written to the data in the __DATA__ section.

=cut

sub have {
    my $have = shift;
    my $key  = _get_key();
    if ( exists $SYNCH_WAS_CALLED{$key} ) {
        confess "Synch was already called for ($key)";
    }

    no warnings 'uninitialized';
    $TIMES_CALLED{$key}{have}++;
    $NEW_DATA_FOR{$key} ||= [];
    push @{ $NEW_DATA_FOR{$key} } => $have;
    return $have;
}

=head2 C<want>

 is have($have), want(), 'have should equal want';

Returns the current expected test result. Attempting to read past the end of
the test results will result in a fatal error.

=cut

sub want {
    my $key = _get_key();
    if ( exists $SYNCH_WAS_CALLED{$key} ) {
        confess "Synch was already called for ($key)";
    }

    unless ( exists $DATA_SECTION_FOR{$key} ) {
        _read_data_section( scalar caller );
    }
    no warnings 'uninitialized';
    $TIMES_CALLED{$key}{want}++;
    my $data_section = $DATA_SECTION_FOR{$key};
    unless (@$data_section) {
        confess("Attempt to read past end of __DATA__ for $0");
    }
    return shift @$data_section;
}

=head2 C<synch>

    synch();

This function will attempt to take all of the values passed to have() and
write them out to the __DATA__ section. If C<have()> and C<want()> have been
called an unequal number of times, this function will die.

Will not attempt to synch the __DATA__ if the tests appear to be passing.
